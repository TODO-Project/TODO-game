# TODO-Game
## What is TODO-Game ?
TODO is a rogue-like game, with a few twists. Thrown in a randomly generated map, you will have to survive waves of ennemies, collect weapons and artifacts, and eventually win the game. But that won't be easy !
## Who are the devs ?
Louis Boulanger and Hugo Venancio ! We are student in first year of a DUT (Diplôme universitaire technologique) in IT, at Annecy-le-Vieux (France).
## Can I contribute ?
Sadly, no. As it is an important project, we are the only ones authorised to make changes to our game.
